This archive contains two Microsoft Visual Studio projects, which provide
the essential files needed to compile and run the programs that were used
to produce the results in this paper.  The projects are coded in Visual
Basic, and can be opened in Visual Studio versions 2010 or later.  The
code for the main statistical routines used in the programs can be
viewed in any text editor, by opening the Visual Basic source files that
are noted in the paragraphs below.

The project in the folder named "Permutation Test" contains the original
version of our permutation test software, which was designed for an unstratified
analysis of endpoints from the Plus-1 and Plus-7 follow-ups of the HS Study.  It
may be opened in Visual Studio by opening the solution file
named "HS Permutation Test.sln" in the main folder.  The Visual Basic
source file named "Form1EsubC.vb" in the main folder contains the
design information for the Windows form that provides the user interface
for the program and the associated Visual Basic code.

The project in the folder named "PermTest Strata" contains a version of
our permutation test software, which was designed for a stratified analysis of
endpoints from the Plus-1 and Plus-7 follow-ups of the HS Study.  It
may be opened in Visual Studio by opening the solution file
named "HS PermTest Strata.sln" in the main folder.  The Visual Basic
source file named "Form1Strata.vb" in the main folder contains the
design information for the Windows form that provides the user interface
for the program and the associated Visual Basic code.

The data inputs for these programs consist of files extracted from SPSS
datasets, as described in the companion archive that contains the datasets
for the endpoints that were reported in the paper.
